# Business Context (External Directories)

If `.claude/settings.local.json` exists in a project (gitignored, so user-dependent), it may contain `additionalDirectories` with useful business context such as:
- Client documentation
- Project specifications
- User Stories and requirements

Check this file when planning features or understanding user stories.

# Token Efficiency

Write frequently referenced documentation in English to minimize token usage.
