# 2025-12-05: Initial Editorial Standards

## Context

After setting up `docs/llm-cli-frontends/` to track daily updates from CLI tools (Claude Code, Codex CLI, Gemini CLI, Opencode), we asked: "Is any of today's news article-worthy?"

**Today's updates:**
- Claude Code v2.0.59: `--agent` flag
- Codex CLI: Codex Max as default
- Gemini CLI v0.19.1: patch release
- Opencode v1.0.133: SAP AI Core provider

**Conclusion:** None of these warrant an article. They're "news" not "articles."

## The Anti-Pattern: 驚き屋

"驚き屋" = someone who hypes every minor update as breaking news. This creates noise, not value.

## Criteria Established

### Worth Writing
1. Paradigm Shift
2. Measurable Superiority
3. Unique Insight
4. Practical Discovery
5. Agentic Orchestration Research

### Exception Noted

Codex Max *might* be worth investigating if it shows genuine superiority over alternatives. The criterion would be #2 (Measurable Superiority) - requires actual testing, not just announcement coverage.

## Open Question

How to efficiently evaluate whether something meets criteria #2 without spending too much time on things that don't pan out?
