# Editorial Standards

Criteria for deciding what's worth writing about.

## Worth Writing

1. **Paradigm Shift** - Fundamentally changes how you work (e.g., when Claude Code first launched)
2. **Measurable Superiority** - Benchmarks or real experience proving "this is different"
3. **Unique Insight** - Analysis or comparison that others haven't written
4. **Practical Discovery** - "Knowing this changes your workflow"
5. **Agentic Orchestration Research** - Findings useful for our agentic-orchestrator project

## Not Worth Writing

- Version number updates
- Feature announcements (without hands-on experience)
- "X just released!" hype posts
- Repackaging press releases

## Principle

Don't be a "驚き屋" (hype person). Write only when you have genuine value to add.
