# Claude Code v2.0.61 - 2025-12-08

Minor release that reverts a feature from v2.0.60.

## Changes

- **Reverted**: VSCode support for multiple simultaneous terminal clients
  - The feature was causing responsiveness issues
  - Originally added in v2.0.60

## Notes

This is a quick fix release addressing user experience issues in the VSCode extension. The multi-terminal support feature will likely return in a future release once the responsiveness problems are resolved.
