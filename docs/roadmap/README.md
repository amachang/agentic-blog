# Roadmap

Internal workspace for planning and tracking blog development.

## Current State

- Initial Astro 5.x project setup complete
- Basic blog structure with posts and tags

## Content Strategy (2025-12-09)

### The Differentiator Principle

Daily research alone isn't publishable content. Articles need at least one of:

| Differentiator | Japanese | Example |
|----------------|----------|---------|
| First-hand reporting | 私の足で稼いだ取材 | Interviews, event coverage |
| My opinions | 私の意見 | Hot takes on trends |
| My expertise | 私の知見 | Deep dives from experience |
| My thoughts | 私の考え | Analysis and synthesis |
| Things I built | 私が実際に手を動かした制作物 | Tutorials, demos, tools |
| Hands-on experience | 私の手を動かした体験 | "I tried X and here's what happened" |

### Immediate Next Steps

1. [ ] Decide which differentiator to apply to current research
2. [ ] Write one article as a proof-of-concept

## Future Plans

Add dated files (YYYYMMDD-topic.md) as needed for planning discussions.
