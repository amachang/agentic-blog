# Closed Issues

This directory contains resolved issues for historical reference.

## Classification

This is an **Archive Directory**: Files are historical records and should not be modified. Do not update files here when ripgrep finds matches.

## Purpose

- Reference how past issues were resolved
- Learn from previous debugging efforts
- Track issue resolution patterns

## File Naming Convention

Files retain their original names from `open/`: `YYYYMMDD-<issue-slug>.md`

## Note

When an issue is resolved, move its file from `../open/` to this directory. Add a resolution summary to the file before moving.
