# Issues Tracking

This directory tracks project issues through their lifecycle.

## Structure

- **`open/`** - Workspace for active issues requiring resolution
- **`closed/`** - Archive Directory for resolved issues

## Workflow

1. Create new issue in `open/` using naming convention `YYYYMMDD-<issue-slug>.md`
2. Update issue status as investigation progresses
3. When resolved, move file to `closed/` with resolution summary

## Documentation Lifecycle

The `open/` directory is a Workspace: its README.md reflects current status, and individual files become archived records when work completes.

The `closed/` directory is an Archive Directory: files are historical records and do not require updates.
