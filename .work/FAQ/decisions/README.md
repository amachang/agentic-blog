# Architectural Decisions

This directory documents important architectural and design decisions made during project development.

## Purpose

- Record the rationale behind key decisions
- Prevent revisiting settled questions
- Guide future architectural choices
- Maintain design consistency

## File Format

Each decision document should include:

1. **Decision**: What was decided
2. **Context**: The situation that required a decision
3. **Options Considered**: Alternative approaches that were evaluated
4. **Rationale**: Why this option was chosen
5. **Consequences**: Expected outcomes and trade-offs
6. **Date**: When the decision was made

## Getting Started

Create your first decision document using the format above. As you add files, they will serve as examples for future documentation.
